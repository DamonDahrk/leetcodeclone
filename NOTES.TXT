Set up Docker yml , started off with next js set up.
Proj avoid classic TS and uses JS with no src file
also prisma and postgres (via docker) 

now using Clerk auth

Clerk handles login, signup, sessions, and user 
profiles so you don’t have to build auth from scratch.
A managed Identity Provider (IdP) + Authentication-as-a-Service (AaaS)

In system design terms, Prisma is a:

Data Access Layer (DAL) + ORM + Schema Management Tool

It sits between your application logic and the database, abstracting raw SQL and enforcing data consistency.

Docker handles

Environment consistency

Dependency isolation

Application packaging

Fast startup & teardown

Predictable deployments

Docker does NOT handle

Auto-scaling (Kubernetes does)

Load balancing

Service discovery

Secrets management (external tools)

REMMEBER TO KEEP AUTH INSIDE THE APP FOLDER FFS

THE WHOLE ISSUE WAS CLERK JWT TOKEN MISTMATCH
FIXED BY DDATE TIME AUTO SCALING 

npx prisma studio to check 

schema changed then added modules then updated async to page js 


suppressHydrationWarning is a React / Next.js attribute used to silence hydration mismatch warnings.

What “hydration” means (quick)

Next.js renders HTML on the server

React then hydrates it on the client (attaches event handlers)

add control space for adding components (importing)

handling the currentUserRole in modules/auth/actions was very safe,
now with that async await (as well as error handling here) caused
us to allow to change user role dynamically from admin to user
and based on that we will be seeing create a problem on the 
navbar
